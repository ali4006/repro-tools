## Installation

Simply install the package with `pip`

    $ pip install spottool

## Spot

Spot identifies the components in a pipeline, at the resolution
level of a system process, that produce different results in different
execution conditions.

### Usage

You must:
* Build Docker images for the pipelines in different conditions 
(e.g. CentOS6 and CentOS7) 
* Create Boutiques descriptor files 
for each condition (See [Boutiques](https://boutiques.github.io/) website)
* Get provenance information using ReproZip tool in one condition (Check [ReproZip](http://docs.reprozip.org/en/1.0.x/packing.html) docs)
* Refer to output directory of one condition as reference and the other one as base
* Set `output_directory` path including all the above mentioned files

To automatically find processes that create differences you must run the `auto_spot` command.
This creates a json file contains of all the processes that create differences.

```
auto_spot output_directory [-c VERIFY_CONDITION] [-e EXCLUDE_ITEMS] [-s SQLITE_DB] [-m WRAPPER] 
          [-o SPOT_OUTPUT] [-d BASE_DESCRIPTOR] [-i BASE_INVOCATION] [-d2 REF_DESCRIPTOR] 
		  [-i2 REF_INVOCATION] [-r REFERENCE_COND] [-b BASE_COND]

-d DESCRIPTOR,                Boutiques descriptor file of the first pipeline condition
-i INVOCATION,                Boutiques invocation file of the first pipeline condition
-d2 DESCRIPTOR_COND2,         Boutiques descriptor file of the second pipeline condition
-i2 INVOCATION_COND2,         Boutiques invocation file of the second pipeline condition
-r REFERENCE_COND,            Path to the result files of the reference condition to capture intransient files.
-b BASE_COND,                 Path to the result files of the base condition.
-s SQLITE_D,                  SQLite database file created by ReproZip tool include dependency files.
-c VERIFY_CONDITION,          Directory path to the text file containing the conditions.
-e EXCLUDE_ITEMS,             The list of files/folders to be ignored.
-m WRAPPER,                   Path to the wrapper script that should be replaced with the original pipeline executables.
-o SPOT_OUTPUT,               Json output file of spot tool that contains process commands and file with differences.
output_directory,             Output directory to keep result files.
``` 


Example of usage:
```
Download the example data folder from `./spot/example/` to <PATH_TO_EXAMPLE>.
Then run:
- docker pull salari/reprotools_project:spot_centos7_latest
- docker tag salari/reprotools_project:spot_centos7_latest spot_centos7_latest
- docker pull salari/reprotools_project:spot_centos6_latest
- docker tag salari/reprotools_project:spot_centos6_latest spot_centos6_latest

- cd <PATH_TO_EXAMPLE>
- auto_spot -d descriptor.json -i invocation.json -d2 descriptor_cond2.json
            -i2 invocation_cond2.json -r centos6 -b centos7
            -s trace_test.sqlite3 -c conditions.txt -e exclude_items.txt
            -m wrapper/wrapper.py -o commands.json <PATH_TO_OUTPUT>
```
You can now look at `commands.json` to see the processes that introduce differences in this example pipeline.
